# -- Personal Project: Connect 4 AI --

By __Chayton Ross__

This is a project using a minimax algorithm to determine optimal turn decisions for an AI opponent in Connect 4.
It somewhat functional, but I intend to continue to improve the project. 
The goal is to add different levels of difficulty, as well as a potential capability to learn and improve its skills. 
Future improvements to reinforcement learning will include <ins>Q-Learning</ins> and potentially a Neural Network.

Future improvements:
1. Clean up bugs (COMPLETE)
2. Allow users to choose which "Game Piece" they want (go first or second) (COMPLETE)
3. Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning
4. Provide different levels of difficulty (easy, medium, hard, extreme)
5. Neural Network

Despite Connect 4 being a _solved game_, I think it would be beneficial to practice working with basic neural networks 
and understanding how a model can develop different strategies to win.
