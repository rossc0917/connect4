-- Personal Project: Connect 4 AI --

By Chayton Ross

This is a project using a minimax algorithm to determine optimal turn decisions for an AI opponent in Connect 4.
It somewhat functional, but I intend to continue to improve the project. 
The goal is to add different levels of difficulty, as well as a potential capability to learn and improve its skills. 
Future improvements to reinforcement learning will include Q-Learning and potentially a Neural Network.
